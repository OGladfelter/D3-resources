				<p>The above chart is a Cleveland dot plot. Each presidential candidate has two data points visualized: the number of days prior to their party's presidential nominating convention that they announced their candidacy, and the number of days prior to the convention that they suspended their campaign. Thus, the line connecting these two dots for each politician visualizes how long the candidate actively sought the presidency for. You'll notice a few lines go right to the '0' boundary - these are the primary winners.</p>
				<p>While the chart is mildly helpful in highlighting unusually long campaigns, it is not easy to interpret. Perhaps a simple lollipop chart, in which each candidate gets one line and circle would be more helpful? In this case, the x-axis should instead represent total days of campaigning, rather than number of days before a specific event (party convention, in this case).</p>
